RESULTS: Winner (1st Place)
This dataset and code is my attempt and submission for SUSS BAIG Python Challenge. 

The code performs the following: 
1. Installs dependencies: matplotlib pandas seaborn openpyxl
2. Perform dataset cleaning
   - Replace other values according to the rules
   - Drop values that do not conform to the rules
   - Address Null and Invalid values
   - Automatically fill null income values based on mean of the respective property type
   - Addressing Income outliers (i.e 66666 value) via Inter Quartile Range
3. Draws insight from the cleaned database
   - Graph 1: Correlation between Education and Income
   - Graph 2: Correlation between Income Level and Spendings
   - Graph 3 : Proportion of income spent on Groceries Spending accross Age and Household Profile
   - Graph 4: Correlation between Income Level, Loans and Credit Card
